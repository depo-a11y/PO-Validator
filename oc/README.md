# oc: order confirmation to PO, PU and delivery file

Pure Python, files in and files out. Nothing here talks to Shopify, Matrixify or Drive.

    python -m oc draft    --oc OC.pdf --catalog export.csv --brand <brand> --out PO-draft.xlsx
    python -m oc complete --po hand_PO.xlsx --oc OC.pdf --catalog export.csv --brand <brand> --out PO.xlsx [--set-price "CODE=EUR"]
    python -m oc finalize --po PO.xlsx --catalog export.csv --brand <brand> --out-prefix <name>-
    python -m oc reconcile --draft PO-draft.xlsx --po hand_PO.xlsx --oc OC.pdf --brand <brand> --out accuracy.md

- `draft` builds the whole buy sheet from the OC. Every drafted cell is shaded green (OC or live
  catalog), amber (past POs or a brand rule) or red (a guess), and the `Review` sheet says why.
- `complete` fills the blanks of a PO someone started by hand and never changes a typed cell, except a
  wholesale price named with `--set-price`, which must equal the OC's.
- `finalize` turns a reviewed PO into `PU-new.xlsx` (through `validator_core.run_gate`, the same gate as
  `app.py`), `PU-merge.xlsx` (season + season tag on carryover, nothing else, Command UPDATE),
  `PU-merge-new-sizes.xlsx`, `PU-merge-ROLLBACK.xlsx` and `Delivery.xlsx`. It is all or nothing: if any check
  fails (the gate, a title still holding a raw code such as "in T2180", a blank colour family) no upload or
  delivery file is written, and exit code is 1.

**Inputs**

- OC PDF: one adapter per layout in `adapters/` (`otb`: Maison Margiela, MM6). Its three gates hard-fail.
- Catalog: a Matrixify Products export (CSV, UTF-8) for the brand's vendors, all statuses, with variants,
  `Variant Cost`, `Variant Country of Origin` and metafields in `my_fields`, `custom` and `global`. Required
  columns are `catalog.REQUIRED`.
- Brand config: `<brand>.local.yaml`, copied from `brands/example.yaml`. It holds the cost multiplier and past
  PO paths, so it never goes in git. Marais keeps the real ones outside the repo in
  `~/Code/marais/_work/oc-brands/`; point the tool there with `export OC_BRAND_DIR=~/Code/marais/_work/oc-brands`
  or pass `--brand-config <file>`. Without either, it falls back to the gitignored `oc/brands/`. Never commit a
  brand config, a catalog export or a PO while this repo is public.

`python tests/mutate_oc.py` re-runs the mutation harness for the guards.

## Cart (linesheet)

    python -m oc draft    ... --cart CART.xlsx
    python -m oc complete ... --cart CART.xlsx

The OC carries codes, quantities and prices but no colour words, composition or names. The brand's
selling-session cart export (OTB: `<BRAND> SS27 AVP X MARAIS, ID <session>.xlsx`) fills part of that gap.
`oc/cart.py` reads it: the header row is found by content in the first 50 rows of any sheet (it must hold
`Model`, `Fabric`, `Color Code`, `Color Description`), one row per style-colour, keyed by the full join key
`<Model><Fabric> <Color Code>`. A Margiela numeric colour code means a different colour on every fabric, so
nothing is ever looked up by the colour code alone. An unreadable file, a missing header or no rows raise
`CartError`.

What the draft takes from the cart, shaded amber with the cart's session and row in the Review sheet:

- title colour words (`<Product> in <Color Description>`, words capitalised); a description with a stray
  character (`Peach Pur}e`) is red;
- colour family: the brand's `colour_families` keywords on that description, the keyword nearest the start
  winning (`Black/Camel` is BLACK). The live catalog's own family for the same fabric+colour still comes first;
- composition (`Materials`) and made in (`Made In`, often blank) for the Body HTML and made_in;
- gender (Female/Male) when the OC has none, the Style Name when the OC has no product class, and Type from
  the brand's `subcategory_types` table when the product class gives none.

Where the live same style+fabric product says the same thing, the cell stays green. The product-name part of a
new title still comes from the catalog (same style+fabric, then same style), else the class name in red.

Never from the cart: quantities, wholesale and retail. Its Sugg. Retail is ignored (OTB sends 0) and a Wholesale
that differs from the OC is an INFO check. Coverage checks: OC codes not in the cart and cart codes not on the OC
(INFO, with counts), and a cart sharing no code with the OC is a FAIL (wrong cart).

Cart text is data, never markup or a formula. A Materials or Made In value holding `<` or `>` is not used
(red, with the reason); other text is HTML-escaped into the Body HTML, while a composition read out of a
live product's Body HTML is already HTML and is left alone. Every sheet written through `oc/poxlsx.py`
(`write_po`, `write_table`, `write_frame`) saves a string starting `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR as text
with its visible value unchanged (no leading apostrophe), and `read_po` resolves only real formula cells.

Brand config keys the cart uses: `colour_families`, `subcategory_types` (cart Subcategory to Type without gender),
`title_prefixes` (which gender's product gets a prefix when two NEW titles collide; default `{WOMEN: "Womens "}`).
A `product_class_types` or `subcategory_types` value may be a list (first valid Type for the gender wins) or a
full Type starting MEN, WOMEN or UNISEX.
